To address this, use Firebase transactions to ensure atomicity of the update operation.  The transaction ensures that the counter is read, incremented, and written back in a single, atomic operation, preventing race conditions.  Here's how to implement the solution:

```javascript
// ... Firebase initialization ...

const incrementCounter = async () => {
  const counterRef = db.ref('counter');
  return counterRef.transaction(currentCounter => {
    if (currentCounter) {
      return currentCounter + 1;
    } else {
      return 1; // Initialize counter if it doesn't exist
    }
  });
};

incrementCounter().then(() => {
  console.log('Counter incremented successfully!');
}).catch(error => {
  console.error('Failed to increment counter:', error);
});
```
This guarantees that the counter will be updated correctly, even with multiple concurrent requests.
